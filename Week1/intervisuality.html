    <h1>Referentiality & Intervisuality in Films</h1>
    <p id="introduction">This webpage will explore how different films accross time and regions reference from each other visually to build conversation. References between films could happen in various forms, the reference to mise-en-scene (costumes, props, sets), to cinematography (image composition, camera angles and movements), to editing and sound, etc. Since this is particularly about the visuality of scenes across different films, therefore it circulates a form of inter-visuality, in parallel to intertextuality, between films.</p>

The film was shot and takes place in Sète in the south of France, 'La Pointe Courte' ('short point') being a tiny quarter of the town, known as the fisherman's village" (qtd from wiki).
